OFB Mode:
Converts a block cipher into a stream cipher.

Keystream is generated independently of the plaintext.
Encryption: ciphertext = keystream ⊕ plaintext
Decryption: plaintext = keystream ⊕ ciphertext

This means:
If you know the IV and send your own plaintext to be encrypted, you can recover the keystream used to encrypt the flag.

So if:
ciphertext_flag = keystream ⊕ flag
ciphertext_input = keystream ⊕ your_plaintext
Then:
ciphertext_input ⊕ your_plaintext = keystream
keystream ⊕ ciphertext_flag = flag

Get the IV and ciphertext of the flag from the /encrypt_flag/ endpoint.
Encrypt known strings using /encrypt/<plaintext>/<iv>/.
Compare returned ciphertexts with the flag ciphertext to guess the flag one character at a time.
